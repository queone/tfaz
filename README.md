Terraform module to manage Azure intrastructures.

Structuring a GitHub repository for a Terraform module, especially one that is designed to manage infrastructure on a platform like Azure, requires careful planning to ensure the repository is easy to use, maintain, and scale. This here is a suggested structure.

Root Directory
README.md: Provide an overview of what your Terraform module does, how to use it, requirements, and any other relevant information.
LICENSE: Include a license file to specify how others can use your module.
.gitignore: Define what files or directories Git should ignore (e.g., .terraform/, *.tfstate, .DS_Store).

Modules
modules/: This directory will contain all your submodules.
modules/<submodule_name>: Each submodule should have its own directory. For example, you might have submodules like network, compute, storage, etc., each tailored to a specific aspect of Azure infrastructure.
main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf, etc.: Standard Terraform files for each submodule.

Examples
examples/: Provide example configurations that demonstrate how to use your master module and submodules.
examples/basic_usage: A simple example that shows how to use the module with minimal configuration.
examples/advanced_usage: More complex examples that show how to use the module in various configurations or combined with other modules.

Docs
docs/: Documentation for the module and each submodule. You might include Markdown files here that document the module's usage, configuration options, and any other important information.
docs/index.md
docs/<submodule_name>.md

Tests
tests/: If you have tests for your module (highly recommended), include them in this directory. You might use a framework like Terratest for this purpose.
tests/<test_name>.go

Main Module Files
main.tf: This file can define the main set of resources that your module will manage. If your module primarily acts as a wrapper or composition of submodules, this file might be minimal or even empty.
variables.tf: Define variables that your module accepts.
outputs.tf: Define outputs that your module provides.
versions.tf: Specify the Terraform version and provider versions required by your module.

CI/CD
.github/workflows/: If you're using GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment, define your workflow files here.
Considerations

Versioning: Use Semantic Versioning for your module versions. Consider using Git tags to mark versions.

Module Registry: If you intend for your module to be used by others, consider publishing it to the Terraform Registry or a private registry for easier consumption.

Documentation: Good documentation is key to a successful module. Ensure that each submodule is well documented along with examples of how to use them.

Naming Conventions: Use clear, descriptive names for variables, outputs, modules, and files to make your module as understandable as possible.

This structure is a starting point. Depending on the complexity and specific needs of your module, you might adjust or expand this structure.
